# Financial-Model
# Project Summary

## Financial Analysis Tab:

- Forecasted out financials for a 5-year period based on 2-year historical data.
- Performed cost analysis and basic statistics such as weighted average, min-max, and median.
- Utilized date functions such as `YEARFRAC()` and `EOMONTH()` for building out a calendar and performing interest calculations.
- Utilized `IF` statements for error checking and data validation on cost analysis.

## Advanced Financial Analysis Tab:

- Built out a common-size income statement to analyze drivers of the income statement for a % of revenue comparison against industry competitors on a year-over-year basis.
- Applied conditional formatting to identify outliers and highlight positive years.
- Created a Sensitivity Analysis for the income statement with a growth percentage driver for measuring change on EBITDA.
- Built scenario analysis utilizing `CHOOSE()` functions and data validation. Modeled out 3 scenarios for future metrics: base case, best case, and downside case.
- Conducted financial valuations using `XIRR` and `XNPV`.
- Built a chart and graph dashboard for high-level analysis of key company metrics.
- Utilized `VLOOKUP`, `HLOOKUP`, and `INDEX(MATCH())` for dynamic queries for key metrics.

- Built a what-if analysis table for net income to examine the impact of fluctuating key drivers.
- Calculated Break Even point using Goal Seek for 2016 revenue.
